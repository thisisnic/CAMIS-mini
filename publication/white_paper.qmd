**Key Considerations When Understanding Differences in Statistical Methodology Implementations Across Programming Languages - An Introduction to the CAMIS Project**

This white paper aims to empower clinical data scientists to make informed choices on the implementation of statistical analyses when multiple languages yield different results. Our objective is not to prescribe what that choice should be, but rather provide guidance on the types of questions clinical data scientists should ask, to identify the fundamental sources of discrepant results. Our objective is also to invite the wider community to contribute to an open-source repository designed for Comparing Analysis Method Implementations in Software (CAMIS: https://github.com/PSIAIMS/CAMIS).
