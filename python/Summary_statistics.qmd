The **numpy.percentile()** function is useful to determine the *n^th^-percentile* for the given array of data. It returns an array with percentile values or a scalar along the specified axis. The function accepts the following parameters:

1.*array*: The array of data whose percentile needs to be calculated.

2.*percentile*: Denotes the percentile that needs to be computed.

3.*axis* (optional): Denotes the axis along which the percentile is calculated. By default, a flattened array is used.

4.*out* (optional): An alternate output array where we can place the result.

5.*overwrite_input* (optional): Used to modify the input array.

6.*keepdims* (optional): Creates reduced axes with dimensions of one size.

```{python}

import numpy as np

sample_data=[12, 25, 16, 50, 34, 29, 60, 86, 52, 39, 41]

percentile = np.percentile(sample_data,75)

print(percentile)

```
